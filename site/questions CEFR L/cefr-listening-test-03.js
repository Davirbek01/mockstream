If you're looking for things to do over the summer, there's lots going on in the area. I'll give you an idea of what you can do now, but for a full program of events, text 1576 and we'll send you a link to all the information you need. To give you a taste of what's on offer, the activity center is running a wide range of activities for all the family. There's climbing for beginners. This is indoors and will be led by experienced teachers. The center has also organized a walk along the coast path for a look at some of the creatures you can find there. The center is open seven days a week with a special open day on the 13th of June to give you an idea of what else is on offer. As you know, our town has a very long history, and those with an interest in the past can sign up for one of the guided walks the history group has organized. Find out where a very well-known celebrity was born and learn about local industry in the past. You can find out more at the History Center, which is located in the Central Library. For film lovers, the Art Center has a full program of films running throughout the summer months. And the Book Festival, which starts on the 14th of August, has several speakers on its program and book readings by some well-known authors. This year, they'll be organizing a question and answer session for anyone interested in writing poetry. The Art Center expects this to be quite popular, so you should call them first to book a place.

      transcript: "Narrator: Exercise 12.\n\nYou will hear five short extracts in which people are talking about what makes a good teacher.\n\nSpeaker 1: I fully accept that everyone's different. So, of course, different teachers will suit different types of children and teenagers. Throughout my education, though, the teachers I responded to best were the ones that tried to push me along a bit by getting me to try a little bit harder. Because the problem for me is that I'm naturally quite a lazy person, and I've always been more interested in life outside the classroom than inside it. So, I'm the kind of person that's perhaps a bit of a headache for teachers. The sort they're not really thinking about when they're studying for their teaching qualifications.\n\nSpeaker 2: Most of the time, a teacher's just doing his or her job, I guess. I mean, they've done their qualification, they're in the classroom, they've got to write your report at the end of terms, saying how you've done, haven't they? Sometimes, you might want to be able to ask your teacher something before or after class, get some advice or extra information, or tell them about some problem. It's the teachers who are there for you in those situations that are special, who take an individual approach. And I don't think it's too hard for them to do that, give you a couple of minutes.\n\nSpeaker 3: Well, I'm a firm believer in the importance of the subject. If a teacher can get the kids absorbed by the subject, be it maths or geography or cookery or whatever, then the job is basically done. The best teachers are the ones who make it look easy because they make it seem fun. Then the kids are fascinated, even amused by the subject, so they want to learn, and each and everyone of them makes progress. I think this often involves the teacher getting everyone to see the relevance of the subject in the wide world beyond the confines of the classroom.\n\nSpeaker 4: Fashions come and go in teaching just as in everything else. We're at a stage at the moment where there's a lot of focus on the individual and getting every child to take responsibility for their own learning, that kind of thing. But you can't just tell kids to be better, to study harder. You also have to demonstrate what you mean by this. So the teacher needs to put in the hours, to mark the homework, to prepare lessons carefully. If kids know the teacher is doing it, then they'll want to do their part too. I think that's the way to do it. Never mind what's in fashion.\n\nSpeaker 5: Perhaps the best thing is for teachers to reflect on how they themselves got to be teachers. How did they achieve success in their qualifications? How did they manage to do well at school? It's down to a question of each and every student making his or her own way, and they only know if they're doing well if they're told by their teacher that they're doing well, or badly. You need to be told the facts about how well you're managing with your studies, in class and in your homework. The truth is that learning's not a game, not just fun, but hard effort.",

It works, honest.\nSpeaker 2: don't suppose we'd go far down that road.\nNarrator: Extract three.\nYou hear two students talking about an experiment into the way people perceive time.\nNow look at questions five and six.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know anything about that experiment the lecturer was referring to?\nSpeaker 2: I've looked it up.\nIt involved this Frenchman spending two months in a cave under a glacier in 1962, I think it was.\nHe was 100 m below ground, and because he had nothing to track the time, no clock, obviously, no sun either, he got disorientated.\nWhen he came back up, he thought he'd been down there for just 34 days.\nVery revealing for the researchers, who'd anticipated it would go the other way.\nVarious stuntmen and entertainers have done similar things to push themselves to extremes, but then, of course, they've always got an eye on the headlines they'll create.\nSpeaker 1: That's fascinating.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nIt's all about temporal landmarks.\nThey're really important.\nIf you build more of them into your life, you'll experience time differently.\nDays and years won't be one undifferentiated mush.\nTemporal landmarks help stop the feeling that time's whizzing by.\nI bet, for example, you retain memories of events that happened near the beginning or end of term.\nThey're kind of landmarks, better than those that happened somewhere in between.\nSpeaker 1: So?\nSpeaker 2: So, establish a few landmarks.\nRemember to mark special events like birthdays properly with some sort of celebration.\nSpeaker 1: That's advice I'm happy to follow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you know anything about that experiment the lecturer was referring to?\nSpeaker 2: I've looked it up.\nIt involved this Frenchman spending two months in a cave under a glacier in 1962, I think it was.\nHe was 100 m below ground, and because he had nothing to track the time, no clock, obviously, no sun either, he got disorientated.\nWhen he came back up, he thought he'd been down there for just 34 days.\nVery revealing for the researchers, who'd anticipated it would go the other way.\nVarious stuntmen and entertainers have done similar things to push themselves to extremes, but then, of course, they've always got an eye on the headlines they'll create.\nSpeaker 1: That's fascinating.\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\nIt's all about temporal landmarks.\nThey're really important.\nIf you build more of them into your life, you'll experience time differently.\nDays and years won't be one undifferentiated mush.\nTemporal landmarks help stop the feeling that time's whizzing by.\nI bet, for example, you retain memories of events that happened near the beginning or end of term.\nThey're kind of landmarks, better than those that happened somewhere in between.\nSpeaker 1: So?\nSpeaker 2: So, establish a few landmarks.\nRemember to mark special events like birthdays properly with some sort of celebration.\nSpeaker 1: That's advice I'm happy to follow.",

      transcript: "Narrator: Exercise 12. You'll hear an interview with a man called Richard Porter, who's a maker of musical instruments called organs.\nNarrator: Good evening, and welcome to the program where, as you know, we go out and talk to people who run their own companies. Today, we're talking to Richard Porter, who makes large concert organs as a profession. Richard, tell us, just how did you get into this area of work?\nRichard: Well, I play the piano and as a child I had a good teacher who wrote her own music and I always wanted to be a composer, too. However, my parents persuaded me that what I needed to do was go to college and study how to make musical instruments rather than play them, because they saw more of a future in that. And now I make the organs which are played in churches and concert halls all around the world.\nThe one thing that I never intended to do was become a businessman, which is what I am now really, as well as being an instrument maker.\nNarrator: So, when did you start making organs?\nRichard: About five years ago. Started from a room in my house, but now I have my own workshop.\nNarrator: So it must pay.\nRichard: Well, an organ sells at £9,500, which means around £3,500 profit for me, I suppose.\nNarrator: And how long does it take to build one?\nRichard: It might take me three months to complete one. And when I say three months, I mean three months of working 70 hours a week. Although that sounds a lot, I have to say I don't mind because I love the work. And I get to meet lots of interesting people. Most of my commissions are from overseas clients and they're nearly all the result of personal contacts. I rarely use advertising these days.\nNarrator: So you make a living out of it.\nRichard: Not really. The most profitable part of my business is actually mending organs, generally old large ones, so they can be used for concerts and recording sessions. That can earn me up to £300 each time, which is just as well, because I do need to have money available to buy the raw materials for the larger organs.\nThere's a lot of investment to make before I can start to build. I get the wood from Britain, but most of the other components come from France or Germany.\nNarrator: And I understand you've made a big decision recently?\nRichard: Yeah. Uh, I've decided to take the opportunity to move my workshop to a former school room that has become available in Lincolnshire, about a hundred miles away.\nNarrator: So you're moving house as well.\nRichard: Yeah, we're moving there in three months' time.\nNarrator: Tell me about the new workshop.\nRichard: Oh, it's a lovely old building attached to the town hall in a small market town. Uh, in return for using the workshop, I've agreed to spend 40 days a year working as a museum attendant. There's a small museum in the town that has visiting exhibitions, but is only open on certain days in the year.\nNarrator: And is that something you're looking forward to?\nRichard: Not really, but it means that I save around £4,000 a year, because apart from paying the heating bill, the workshop is rent-free.\nNarrator: Oh.\nRichard: That's the great thing about the place. It's also very close to our new house, so I'll have the luxury of walking to work each morning, which is nice.\nNarrator: Is it easy to find a building that is suitable as a workshop?\nRichard: No, it isn't. It's very easy for the instruments to get damaged, so the environment must be dry. None of the buildings I've worked in so far have been dry enough. The new workshop is perfect in that respect.\nNarrator: All right. Well, best of luck to you in that new project. Now, I think you're going to play us a piece on an organ which you built yourself?\nRichard: Yes, absolutely.\nNarrator: Now you'll hear part two again.\nNarrator: Good evening, and welcome to the program where, as you know, we go out and talk to people who run their own companies.
