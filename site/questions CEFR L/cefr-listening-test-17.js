Speaker: Okay, everyone. Now, I need to say a few things about our visit to Staunton Theater next Tuesday. You need to be here at school at 6 o'clock. We'll meet by the back gate because the coach can't stop at the front one. We can't leave any later than six as the play starts at 7:30. We're seeing a very interesting play called the party by Andrew McVty. It's a comedy about a birthday celebration. His works can be difficult to understand, so you need to the play in advance. There is a copy for everybody which you can pick up from the school secretary. Do that as soon as you can. I'll hand out the theater tickets on the coach. We're all sitting together in rows E and F. The full price of these tickets is 18 pounds, but you're lucky because I've managed to get a discount for the group, so you only have to pay £15.75 each. Could you let me have this money before Tuesday, please, and £3.50 for the coach. Now, a lot of you have suggested going somewhere together afterwards. Well, the coach driver is willing to come back a bit later, but there isn't time for a three course meal. So, we'll go to a cafe, I know nearby, for an ice cream and a coffee. Don't forget to bring some money for that. I've arranged for the coach to make an extra stop before it comes back to the school. So, for those of you who need to take the bus home, it will be possible for you to get off at the bus station. If you decide to take a taxi, you should find plenty of taxis there, or you can walk to the main square. Right. Any questions?
Narrator: Now listen again.

Speaker 1: I never thought I'd enjoy mixing creativity with technology, but here I am. People come to me with ideas and I bring them to life in a way that's both useful and beautiful. Once, I made something for a small bakery, and seeing their excitement when they showed it off to their customers was unforgettable. It's like painting, but instead of using brushes, I use a keyboard and a screen. The work can be stressful when deadlines are tight, but it's worth it when I see how my creations help people.

Speaker 2: I never thought my voice and ideas would reach so many people, but now they do. Sharing my thoughts feels like having a conversation with thousands of friends. I cover a lot. Sometimes I talk about my favorite hobby, gaming, and other times, I dive into topics that help people learn or improve their lives. My favorite moment was when someone messaged me saying, I inspired them to start their own creative journey. It's not just about videos or content, it's about connecting with people in ways I never imagined.

Speaker 3: I've always believed that learning should be an adventure, not a chore. That's why I fill my days with laughter, creativity, and play. One of my favorite moments was when a quiet student finally joined one of the group games I organized. Seeing their eyes light up as they solved a challenge with their classmates reminded me why I do this. My job isn't about teaching facts, it's about helping little minds discover and grow. It's not always easy, but the rewards are worth every effort.

Speaker 4: I've always loved puzzles and creating something out of nothing, so my work feels like a dream come true. Recently, I worked on a project where I combined learning and fun. Watching kids enjoy what I created and hearing parents say it's helping with school, made me proud. Of course, it's not always easy. Sometimes I stare at the screen for hours trying to fix a problem. But when it works, it feels like magic. It's like being both a storyteller and a problem solver at the same time.

Speaker 1: Okay. Now, a word about the layout of the center. Our beautiful facility has 25 rooms altogether, which are both very functional and aesthetically pleasing. We're standing here right at the entrance. To your left, you can see two rooms in a row. After each dance session, you're probably soaking in sweat and in desperate need of a shower. Just go straight ahead, turn left, and the shower room is on your left-hand side. If you just want to take a nap, there is a six-bed bunk room. It's immediately to the left of where you are standing, right before the shower room. We also have a games room with dart boards, table tennis, pool, and card games. It is a good place to have fun with friends. Just take the first right. It is the second area to your right. You can explore it well later during our tour. Further ahead, in the corner, there are the bike racks. You can either park your bike here or hire one if you want to ride. The first hour is free. Part of our dance sessions will take place in the music room. It has a large mirror with various musical instruments and state-of-the-art stereos. If you want to get there, just go straight, take the second right, and it's the second area to your left. Our friendly reception team is an invaluable resource for any visitor to the center. If your mobile phone needs charging, we have several adapters and can easily get your phone back up and running again. We also offer a range of chargeable services, including photocopy, scanning, and faxing. The reception is located in the center to the south of the music room. There is a medical center providing a full spectrum of care and treatment, especially for sports injuries like a sprained knee. It's right opposite the reception, to the left of the music room. Now, I have to tell you about our gym, where some of our dance sessions take place. It is also equipped with the latest equipment, including exercise bikes, treadmills, rowing machines, etc. If you walk straight ahead before you come to the end and turn right, it's the second room to your left. And speaking of food, if you ever feel hungry, you can either cook in the kitchen or grab a snack at the store. To reach it, keep straight on until you get to the third passageway, turn right, and it's the one after the gym, and the kitchen sits right next to the gym on the same side of the passageway. It has all the utensils you'll need, spatulas, frying pans, ladles, and plates. You name it. Just feel free to use it. By the way, if you have coats, umbrellas, or any large bags with you, the cloakroom is available. It's the room in the top right corner on the far side. Right. Well, if you're ready, we'll start the tour of our lovely community center.

It's immediately to the left of where you are standing, right before the shower room. We also have a games room with dart boards, table tennis, pool, and card games. It is a good place to have fun with friends. Just take the first right. It is the second area to your right. You can explore it well later during our tour. Further ahead, in the corner, there are the bike racks. You can either park your bike here or hire one if you want to ride. The first hour is free. Part of our dance sessions will take place in the music room. It has a large mirror with various musical instruments and state-of-the-art stereos. If you want to get there, just go straight, take the second right, and it's the second area to your left. Our friendly reception team is an invaluable resource for any visitor to the center. If your mobile phone needs charging, we have several adapters and can easily get your phone back up and running again. We also offer a range of chargeable services, including photocopy, scanning, and faxing. The reception is located in the center to the south of the music room. There is a medical center providing a full spectrum of care and treatment, especially for sports injuries like a sprained knee. It's right opposite the reception, to the left of the music room. Now, I have to tell you about our gym, where some of our dance sessions take place. It is also equipped with the latest equipment, including exercise bikes, treadmills, rowing machines, etc. If you walk straight ahead before you come to the end and turn right, it's the second room to your left. And speaking of food, if you ever feel hungry, you can either cook in the kitchen or grab a snack at the store. To reach it, keep straight on until you get to the third passageway, turn right, and it's the one after the gym, and the kitchen sits right next to the gym on the same side of the passageway. It has all the utensils you'll need, spatulas, frying pans, ladles, and plates. You name it. Just feel free to use it. By the way, if you have coats, umbrellas, or any large bags with you, the cloakroom is available. It's the room in the top right corner on the far side. Right. Well, if you're ready, we'll start the tour of our lovely community center.

Narrator: You hear two photography students called Bella and Simon talking about cameras.
Simon: These new landscape images that you've taken are great, Bella.
Bella: Thanks, Simon. I've been experimenting with my new super high definition camera, and it's really exciting what it can do.
Simon: Really? I would never have thought you could get this kind of resolution from any camera. I mean, simple digital cameras have their merits, but this new megapixel resolution technology brings photography to a whole new level.
Bella: I agree. I also think simple digital cameras are good, but once you have a high resolution image like this one on your laptop, you can work on it in so many ways without worrying about the image's pixel structure becoming visible. It certainly needs better software for the best results.
Simon: I guess you have a point. Maybe it's something that I should try myself. I mean, I like using my digital camera, but this new megapixel camera is out of this world.
Bella: Well, if you're interested, I can tell you where I got mine from.
Simon: Thanks.

Narrator: You hear a university tutor talking to a student called Kelvin about a project.
Tutor: Morning, Kelvin. Come in and have a seat. How are you today?
Kelvin: I'm fine, thanks. I guess you want to see me about the geography project.
Tutor: Yes. I'm a bit concerned that you aren't going to complete it on time, since you changed your topic two weeks into the assignment.
Kelvin: I know what you mean. Well, I was a bit bothered about that myself. So, I've been doing a lot of extra hours to catch up, and I'm certain I'll meet the deadline now.
Tutor: Oh, well done. I'd like you to send me what you've written so far.
Kelvin: But it's not in its final form yet, and there will be mistakes. So, I don't want you to see it until I'm happy with it.
Tutor: Don't worry. I understand that. And I won't be marking it now. I just want to check that you're including the correct kind of information, because your last project was beautifully done, but unfortunately, a large amount of text wasn't entirely relevant. You don't want to lose marks again, do you?
Kelvin: Oh, okay. I understand now. I'll send you through the first half of the project later on today. Shall I email it to you at the usual address?
Tutor: Yes, that'll be perfect.

Narrator: You hear two students called Guy and Rebecca talking about a presentation they are preparing.
Guy: What's up, Rebecca? You look really anxious.
Rebecca: I'm really stressed out. I don't think I'm the right person to organize our presentation. Maybe you should be in charge of it.
Guy: You must be joking. You are the most efficient person I know. I think we should stick with the procedure that we agreed on.
Rebecca: I'm still doubtful. I mean, what if our argument isn't dynamic enough or convincing?
Guy: But you said the same before our last presentation, and it turned out to be incredible. We got excellent feedback from it.
Rebecca: I guess so. So, where do we go from here?
Guy: Just focus on the key point. We aren't interested in politics or blaming governments. As young people, we want to emphasize that everyone, wealthy or poor, young or elderly, needs to play their part to bring climate change to an end.
Rebecca: Okay. You have a valid point. Let's get on with our meeting with the others and finish our preparation.

At the height of its popularity in the 19th century, the Royal Canadian Pacific was sometimes described as the most beautiful railway route in the world. But during the 20th century, it had declined to the point where passenger trains no longer ran along its 20,000 kilometers of lines. Then, in 2000, 1000 km passenger service started again, and this was the one I traveled on in my own private sleeping compartment, sharing a coach with 15 other people. The four-day journey began and ended in Calgary, the largest city in Alberta, and one that has received international praise for being a pleasant place to live. The Economist magazine recently placed it equal fifth in a list of the world's top cities to live in, while, according to another study that looked at which is the cleanest, it came top. It is located close to the Rocky Mountains, which are crossed at two different points by the railway line. At various points along the route, the peaks rise over a kilometer straight up from the line. So, although they aren't as tall as those in the US, they're so steep that their appearance is breathtaking. Scenes of trains winding their way through beautiful green valleys next to spectacular snow-covered peaks are, of course, often associated with Canada, especially in films, and the Canadian Pacific has become known throughout the world as a result of images of it appearing on the nation's stamps. So, it was with some excitement that I boarded the train that morning, and immediately I was impressed by the luxury of the accommodation. It was like stepping back into another age, apart from the fact that each of the eight coaches had air conditioning. The weather there in August was hot, so that was a welcome feature. As was the fact that I'd have a shower to myself. The furniture was old, but of extremely high quality, and the chairs and beds were highly comfortable. The meals, naturally, were superb, and were always prepared on board by top chefs. We had our own waiter in each coach, of course, but what I hadn't expected was that all of us would be served at a single large dining table, which could also be used for business meetings. The 16 of us soon came to enjoy sitting together for evening meals, as these were actually more like dinner parties, with everyone in formal dress and live music as entertainment.
On other journeys, apparently, they sometimes have performances of classical guitar. Though on this occasion, it was violin. The next day, we traveled along a river valley with marvelous views of the mountain scenery until we reached Emerald Lake, where the train stopped for us to go on a forest trek to observe the local wildlife. There were plenty of salmon splashing about in the river, and we saw a mountain goat on a track high above us. It would have been great to have spotted a bear, but on that particular day, we were out of luck. Though I'm sure I saw a wolf, and there was certainly an eagle flying overhead at one point. Back on the train, we went up and over kicking horse pass, descending what is known as the Big Hill. Each of the coaches weighs 100 tons. So, when the driver used the brakes to slow down, they sent up a cloud of black smoke, which was clearly visible to those of us sitting by the windows. On our last evening, we came to another remarkable site near Lethbridge, Alberta's fourth biggest city. Looking like a giant spider's web, the mile-long bridge across the Oldman River is larger than any other of that type in the entire continent. The following morning, we arrived back in Calgary, after what must surely be the most wonderful train journey in North America.

Narrator: Now listen again.
