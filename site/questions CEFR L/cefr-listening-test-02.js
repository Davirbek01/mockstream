It was only a small hotel and we were looked after like family. The room had loads of soft toys, wooden toys, and and books, which the children loved. The guest lounge and conservatory was a child-free zone after 7:30, which suited us fine, because there was a special children's supper at 6:00, which meant that they could go to bed early and get a good night's sleep. Older children aren't really catered for, and this hotel is probably better for those with younger kids.\n\nNarrator: Now you'll hear part three again.\n\nNarrator: Speaker one.\nSpeaker 1: We chose this hotel because we knew that the owners had young children of their own.\nThe room could have been a bit bigger, but then it was quite inexpensive.\nThey provided an early supper if you told them in good time, so that the parents could eat in peace later in the cozy dining room.\nThere were hundreds of toys for the children to play with, a huge garden with a playground, ponds, and a playhouse.\nWe hardly saw our two all week.\n\nNarrator: Speaker two.\nSpeaker 2: We always have difficulty finding hotels which welcome our children.\nThis one was particularly good because the bedroom had a separate sitting room, so we weren't all squashed together in one room.\nAlthough it wasn't the cheapest around, far from it in fact, it was worth it.\nOur teenage kids love the outdoor heated swimming pool and the mountain bikes, which were provided free by the hotel.\nApparently, the owner's kids who've grown up and left home now, had been mad on mountain biking.\nThere was also an all weather tennis court.\nAnother thing we liked was the separate dining room for people with young families.\n\nNarrator: Speaker three.\nSpeaker 3: We'd had a bad experience the year before at a hotel which didn't cater for children.\nBut this year we were very impressed by the hospitality of the hotel.\nThe rooms were large enough to accommodate four beds comfortably, and there was an adventure playground in the garden for the younger kids.\nYou don't have to pay for children under 10 sharing the room.\nEven meals were free for them, so that was another bonus.\nThere was lots to do including horse riding and tennis, but if you wanted to swim, you had to go to the local leisure center, which the kids loved.\n\nNarrator: Speaker four.\nSpeaker 4: In the hotel we went to, we had a family suite, which was very spacious.\nThere was an outdoor heated pool and large grounds, so the kids spent most of the time in the pool.\nSo long as your children like swimming, you're all right, because, uh, there wasn't much else for them to do.\nI did think that they could have put in a playground, too.\nYoung children under 10 aren't allowed in the dining room, but there was an early supper for them.\nThis meant that we could have a quiet dinner for two when they were in bed.\n\nNarrator: Speaker five.\nSpeaker 5: What we liked about our hotel was its size.

Councillor Thornton again.\nSpeaker 2: Well, since we managed to extend the recreation ground, we've spent some time talking to local people about how it could be made a more attractive and useful space. If you have a look at the map up on the screen, you can see the river up in the north, and the community hall near the entrance from the road. At present, cars can park between the community hall and that line of trees to the east, but this is quite dangerous for pedestrians. So, we're suggesting a new car park on the opposite side of the community hall, right next to it. We also have a new location for the cricket pitch. As we've now purchased additional space to the east of the recreation ground, beyond the trees, we plan to move it away from its current location, which is rather near the road, into this new area beyond the line of trees. This means there's less danger of stray balls hitting cars or pedestrians. We've got plans for a children's playground, which will be accessible by a footpath from the community hall, and will be alongside the river. We'd originally thought of having it close to the road, but we think this will be a more attractive location. The skateboard ramp is very popular with both younger and older children. We had considered moving this up towards the river, but in the end we decided to have it in the southeast corner near the road. The pavilion is very well used at present by both football players and cricketers. It will stay where it is now, to the left of the line of trees and near to the river, handy for both the football and cricket pitches. And finally, we'll be getting a new notice board for local information, and that will be directly on people's right as they go from the road into the recreation ground.\nNarrator: Now listen again.\nSpeaker 1: So, next on the agenda is proposals for improvements to the recreation ground.

Now look at questions one and two.\nNarrator: Recently, a whole pile of my clothes got chucked out after a flatmate mistook them for rubbish. I was so upset.\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no.\nNarrator: I don't get me wrong. It wasn't that they held any particular significance for me or had any great value. It was the prospect of shopping for new stuff I couldn't face.\nSpeaker 2: Tell me about it. Even if there's like something I need to get, my trick is to put it off to the last possible moment. So, I'll have less chance to waste time on such a pointless activity. Maybe that's why people think our clothes are rubbish.\nNarrator: Yeah, but what gets me is that I reckon for a lot of people, the clothes aren't the point. It's more about the act of shopping. It's heavily linked to wanting to be the center of attention to clothes giving them a strong personal identity or whatever. It's basically a way of showing off. Too much importance is placed on clothes and appearance, but it's not like a political issue for me. It's just a game I'm not prepared to play.\nNarrator: Recently, a whole pile of my clothes got chucked out after a flatmate mistook them for rubbish.

Too much importance is placed on clothes and appearance, but it's not like a political issue for me. It's just a game I'm not prepared to play.\nNarrator: Extract two. You hear part of an interview with a musician called Max. Now look at questions three and four.\nSpeaker 1: So, was music in the blood, Max?\nSpeaker 2: Do you mean, did my mom play the piano? Hardly. But I was well into the charts as a boy. In all honesty, I didn't think that being number one was something completely unattainable. I had a cockiness, but I kept it hidden from my peers. I'd hear a hit record and think, I could do that. From the age of 14, I fired off loads of demo discs I made in my bedroom. I had a folder where I kept all the rejection letters I got from record labels. It might have helped to share that with somebody, but I didn't. I just sulked, then had another go.\nSpeaker 1: Then when you did get a contract?\nSpeaker 2: I was vindicated. And it was a good deal in most respects too. Funny thing was though, if after my first hit, I'd thought I'd made it, I was soon disabused of that notion. If I was to add up everything I'd done up till that point, school, working in a factory, learning the guitar, making the demos. It doesn't compare. I've had to put in a lot of effort to capitalize on that breakthrough, I can tell you.\nSpeaker 1: So, was music in the blood, Max?\nSpeaker 2: Do you mean, did my mom play the piano? Hardly. But I was well into the charts as a boy. In all honesty, I didn't think that being number one was something completely unattainable. I had a cockiness, but I kept it hidden from my peers. I'd hear a hit record and think, I could do that. From the age of 14, I fired off loads of demo discs I made in my bedroom. I had a folder where I kept all the rejection letters I got from record labels. It might have helped to share that with somebody, but I didn't. I just sulked, then had another go.\nSpeaker 1: Then when you did get a contract?\nSpeaker 2: I was vindicated. And it was a good deal in most respects too.

You hear part of a discussion program in which two dancers are talking about their careers. Now look at questions five and six.\nSpeaker 1: It's really interesting because I didn't dance when I was in Hong Kong. I didn't pick up dance till I went to high school in the US, and that was probably like when I was 16 years old. Again, I didn't do it consciously. It wasn't like something that I was waiting to do. One time I danced in a culture show and the dance director at my school, she asked, are you interested in really training? Like, you seem to have talent. And at that point, I was really not interested. I was an athlete, a three-season athlete. I was more interested in like hanging with the guys and doing what I was used to. But when I saw her perform, I was blown away and decided it was for me. And at college I majored in it. I trained classically.\nSpeaker 2: That's so unlike my experience. I mean, I was dancing almost before I could walk. And although I wouldn't say I was pressurized into it, my parents were like behind me every step of the way. So much so that I was on the point of rebellion on more than one occasion. Though I'm happy to say that particular storm never actually broke.\nSpeaker 1: It's really interesting because I didn't dance when I was in Hong Kong.

      transcript: "Exercise 18. You'll hear a short radio report about how technology is helping archeologists who want to learn more about some texts written over 2,000 years ago, known as Roman tablets.\n\nAt the time of the Roman Empire in Europe, around 2,000 years ago, it was common for information to be written not on paper, but on things called tablets. These were pieces of wood about the size and thickness of a typical modern envelope. Hundreds of such tablets have been unearthed from archeological sites throughout Europe and the Mediterranean world. Nearly 200 were found in one Roman fort alone. And like most of these discoveries, they have been placed in public collections, mainly in museums in Northern Europe, to be viewed, but not, unfortunately, to be read. This is because, although in some cases traces of writing can still be seen, most are now illegible to the naked eye. But that's all soon to change, because archeologists hope that with the help of new technology, their secrets may soon be revealed. Many of the tablets took the form of legal documents and letters written by Roman soldiers. An example, now at the British Museum, bears the name of the person who wrote it, and the name of the person who received it, plus the word transportation, which you can just make out. But the rest remains a mystery. Now, with the help of computer techniques, experts hope eventually to be able to read the whole letter. Professor Mike Brady, a leading figure in what's known as computer vision for many years, admits that this is the hardest project he's ever worked on. But the excitement of seeing the latest ideas in computing applied to such a very ancient problem has the archaeological community buzzing. So, in simple terms, why has the writing been preserved? And how will it be possible to undo the aging process? Well, the tablets were made with thin, hollow panels cut across them. Wax was poured into these, and the text was then written into this soft surface using an instrument with a fine metal point. In virtually all cases, the wax has perished, and all that can be detected on the surface of the tablet underneath are scratches. These are too faint to be read because they are distorted.\nFor some time, scientists have attempted to study them with laser photography, but this has proved fruitless. However, it is now hoped that by enhancing images of the tablets on computer, their original messages will become legible again. If this is the case, a whole new source of historical information will be opened up, and this promises advances and new knowledge for many decades to come. The new technology has already been used on texts in ink as well, and in the future, it will be applied to damaged surfaces of many kinds.\n\nNow you'll hear the recording again.\nAt the time of the Roman Empire in Europe, around 2,000 years ago, it was common for information to be written not on paper, but on things called tablets.
