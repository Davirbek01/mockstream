The researchers ___4___ this to the way boredom forces the mind into a state in which it can wander freely, making unexpected connections that a tightly focused mind cannot. ___5___ short, the very experience we are all so keen to ___6___ at all costs may be one of the most useful conditions a brain can be in.\n\nIt is no accident, then, that many of the most ___7___ thinkers of the past century described long periods of apparent inactivity as the foundation of their best work.

        instruction: "You are going to read a magazine article about an architect with an unusual approach to his profession. For questions 31–36, choose the answer (A, B, C or D) which you think fits best according to the text.",
        title: "The architect who refuses to build",
        passage:
          "When 47-year-old Daniel Mendes was awarded one of his country's most prestigious architecture prizes last year, the judges expected a short acceptance speech and a polite handshake. What they got was an apology. \"I am, I'm afraid, increasingly persuaded that we should be building far less than we currently do,\" Daniel told the audience, \"and I am uncomfortable accepting an award which assumes that the only response to a problem is to design a new building.\" He thanked the judges sincerely, and added that he had not designed a new building of his own for almost six years.\n\nDaniel did not start out with these views. After studying at one of the better architecture schools in his country, he spent the first decade of his career working on the kind of small modern houses that fill the magazines: low-energy, glass-fronted, photographed at sunset. The work was successful. Several of his early houses won prizes; a few of them appeared in international design publications. But by his late thirties, Daniel began to notice something that quietly bothered him. The houses he had designed in his twenties were almost all being demolished and replaced. Some had survived no more than fifteen years.\n\nThis was not, Daniel insists, because the houses had been badly built. They had been demolished, in nearly every case, because their first owners had moved away, and the second owners had wanted something different. \"It became increasingly difficult to convince myself,\" Daniel says, \"that the work I was doing was anything other than expensive temporary decoration. We were using a great deal of concrete, a great deal of steel, and a great deal of skilled labour, in order to produce buildings that would last about a third of the time of the buildings we were replacing.\"\n\nSlowly, Daniel began turning down new commissions and instead taking on a kind of work that had once been considered unfashionable in his profession: the careful conversion of older buildings. His first project of this kind was a small, abandoned post office in a coastal town, which he turned into a public library and reading room, using as much of the original structure as possible. The project took longer than a new building would have, and earned him only a modest fee. It was, he now says, the most professionally satisfying year of his life.\n\nDaniel's recent projects have followed the same pattern. A disused factory has become an indoor market for local food producers; an empty 1960s school has been turned into seventeen affordable apartments without changing the building's external appearance; a half-collapsed barn has become a small concert hall whose acoustics, by happy accident, are remarkable. None of these projects, Daniel admits, would have been possible without the patience of the local councils involved, who agreed to longer timelines and more flexible budgets than developers usually accept.\n\nHis critics — and he has some — argue that this approach is only realistic for a small number of buildings, and that growing populations will inevitably require new construction at a large scale. Daniel does not entirely disagree. \"I don't claim that nobody should build anything new ever again,\" he says. \"I claim, much more modestly, that the question 'should we build something new here?' is a question that is almost never asked seriously. We assume the answer in advance, and that, I think, is a mistake.\"\n\nWhen asked, finally, whether he would ever return to designing new buildings, Daniel is silent for an unusually long time. \"I might,\" he says eventually. \"But I would want, before I did, to be able to imagine very clearly what the building was going to look like in two hundred years' time. If I cannot, I think the right thing is not to start.\"",

Each year, the same comfortable, middlebrow novels are rewarded — books that are perfectly competent and quietly forgettable — while genuinely original work is filtered out by a process that strongly favours consensus over courage. What is less often discussed is the effect this has on the writers who do not win. To be shortlisted three times and never selected can break a serious career, in part because publishers and reviewers often treat unsuccessful nominees as worse than ignored. The careful exclusion of risk that prize-giving culture rewards has, I believe, slowly hollowed out the kind of fiction we now have available to read."

Yet I have come to believe that the larger and more general a prize becomes, the worse it is at the job it claims to do. The small, specific prizes — the regional, the early-career, the genre-defined — still work. The big general prizes increasingly produce the kind of crushing public attention that, I suspect, has ended at least as many careers as it has helped."

Some of this scorn is well placed; particular choices are sometimes hard to defend, and any system that rewards a single book each year will inevitably be unfair to the others. Yet the wider effects are, I would argue, mostly positive. Without prizes, several of the most demanding art forms — serious poetry, literary translation, experimental fiction — would simply not reach the audiences they currently reach. A reader who would never normally pick up a translated novel will pick up a winner because of the prize; a few of those readers will discover a lasting passion for translated work.

Most prizes are decided by a small number of judges, given an enormous reading list, an unreasonably short period of time, and a final meeting in which the most determined voices, rather than the most thoughtful ones, tend to win. The process inevitably favours books that all five judges can agree on, which is rarely the most interesting book on the list. Worse, judging panels are often selected with at least one eye on the publicity they will generate. We do not, in the end, reward the best work; we reward the work that survives all this contact with the practical world."

          "For most of my professional life, I prided myself on the speed at which I could get through books. I was a journalist, and I had been told, at twenty-three, by a more experienced colleague that the trick was to read every book in the way you would read a long magazine article: skim hard, look for the argument, mark the four or five passages that mattered, and put the book back on the shelf within a single afternoon. For about fifteen years, this was the way I read.\n\n___1___\n\nThe realisation came, oddly, in the middle of a long flight. I had taken with me a new biography of a writer I had been planning to interview, and I was halfway through it before I understood that I had not really retained any of what I had just read. My eyes had been moving across the pages; my hand had been turning them; but somewhere in the previous hour, I had become a sort of human scanner, taking in shapes without meaning. I closed the book, put it under the seat, and did not open it again for the rest of the flight.\n\n___2___\n\nFor the first month, the experiment was extremely uncomfortable. I felt, more or less continuously, that I was wasting time. A book that would once have taken me two afternoons now took me a week. I had to fight, almost physically, the urge to turn the next page before I had really finished the previous one.\n\n___3___\n\nThen, very gradually, something began to change. I noticed that I was beginning to remember sentences — not in any methodical way, but accidentally, the way you might remember a remark made by a friend in passing. Months after finishing a book, I would still find a particular phrase coming into my head as I walked to the office.\n\n___4___\n\nIt became clear, in time, that this was not a small change in my reading habits but a larger change in what I was doing when I read at all. When I had been reading at speed, I had been treating books as sources of information — material to be processed and used, like the official statistics or interview notes I dealt with at work. Reading slowly, I had begun to treat them as something different: as the company of another mind.\n\n___5___\n\nI do not, in the end, recommend slow reading to everyone. Many people, including most professional researchers, have to cover huge amounts of material under genuine time pressure, and there is nothing dishonest about the kind of reading I had spent fifteen years doing. What I would say, more carefully, is that we may be using only one of two distinct kinds of reading and missing the benefits of the other.\n\n___6___\n\nFor my own part, I now keep two reading shelves at home. The shelf above my desk is for the books I read for work — fast, marked up, occasionally annotated. The shelf above the bed is for the books I read slowly. The two shelves do not talk to each other very often. But the slow shelf, I am now sure, is where the rest of my life is quietly being made.",

The hours were long, but lots of people work long hours; the work was abstract, but lots of work is abstract. The change came one Tuesday afternoon, in a long meeting about a property dispute that I knew, with strange clarity, would be exactly forgotten by both sides within five years. I left the office at six, walked half an hour through the city, sat down on a bench in a small park I had never noticed before, and quietly understood that I had been in the wrong life for almost a decade. I bought my first three hives the following spring; I now keep eighteen, and I have not been late to bed once."

            body: "I knew I wanted to leave clinical medicine for several years before I found the courage to do so. The trigger, when it came, was almost trivial. I was on a long shift in the emergency department, and a parent had brought in a child of about six who had a very small injury but who was, understandably, frightened. I spent eight or nine minutes with the child, mostly explaining what the equipment in the room did, and the child went home laughing. The rest of my evening was the usual mix of severely ill adults, exhaustion and paperwork. As I drove home at three in the morning, I realised that I had spent more energy on those eight minutes with the child than on anything else I had done all night. The next morning I began to enquire about teacher training. I have been teaching seven-year-olds for five years now, and I am happier than I have been since I was a student myself."

            body: "I had been writing code for the same large technology company for six years, and the work, by any external measure, was excellent. I was paid well; I was respected; I was given interesting problems to solve. The trouble was that, at some point I cannot precisely identify, I had stopped finding any of it meaningful. I had inherited an old film camera from my grandfather, and I had begun, in my evenings, to film small portraits of people in my neighbourhood — a butcher, a former opera singer, an elderly woman who could not, by then, see her own twin sister. When one of these short films was selected for a small festival in another country, the gap between what excited me and what paid my bills became impossible to ignore. I left my job four months later. The first two years as a filmmaker were extremely hard financially, and I cannot honestly recommend the change to anyone with significant family responsibilities; for me, however, it has been the right decision in every other sense."

I read endless documents, attended endless meetings, and gave endless presentations, but I could not have shown anyone a finished, physical thing that I had made with my own hands. I had been making small items of furniture in my garage at weekends for several years before this, and the contrast between the two parts of my life was getting harder to live with. The actual decision to leave was prompted by a small back injury that kept me at home for two weeks. By the end of those two weeks, I had built a sturdy bookcase for my children's bedroom and I had not opened my work laptop. The injury healed; I never went back to the office. I now run a small workshop with two younger colleagues, and we make almost everything to order."
